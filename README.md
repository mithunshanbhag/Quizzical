Currently, this CLI app can generate the following types of quizzes:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ✔ `Multiple-choice` | Questions with multiple answer choices, and one correct answer. |
| ✔ `True/false` | Questions with a true or false answer. |
| ❌ `Sequence` |Answer involves arranging items in the correct sequence (e.g. chronological order, series, etc). |
| ❌ `Match` | Answer involves matching items to one another. |

>I'm building this app purely for the purpose of horsing around with OpenAI and Semantic Kernel (chat completions, assistants, etc).
